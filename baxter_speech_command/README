Speech to text for use on Brown Robotic's Baxter - developed with CMU's Sphinx toolkit for speech recognition.

(1) ISSUING NATURAL LANGUAGE COMMANDS

To issue a command to Baxter, run roslaunch on the speaker.launch file in this package. You will then be prompted to speak.

The results will be published to the rostopic speech_command

(2) CHANGING THE LANGUAGE MODEL

The current corpus is located in src/apps/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/baxter/baxter_corpus.txt. Either create a corpus of your own or add to this one, and use CMU's Sphinx knowledge base builder at: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html and store the resulting language model in src/apps/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/baxter/baxter_trigram.lm

If the dictionary, either acoustic or text, does not contain some of the words you have included, you may augment these, located in models/acoustic/ and models/language/. For a tutorial on how to add words to the language model, see: myknowledge-killer.blogspot.com/2011/06/expanding-dictionary-of-acoustic-model.html

There is also a tutorial provided by CMU for training the acoustic model located here: http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialam

(3) TO BUILD

In case you require a clean build:

Run: "ant -find demo.xml" to build, and then you will be able to run through the normal python script (speech_to_text.py).
